Tests currently focus only on urlgrabber and request signing

In order to run you either need to add YUM packages to your PYTHON_PATH
or you need to comment out code from createGrabber() on down in s3.py

You also need to edit testvalues.py to include you aws_key_id and aws_secret_key,
and edit the urls and filenames to point to an existing file on an existing s3 bucket
that you have access to.
